# Memory Card Game 🧠🃏

A simple memory card matching game built with **React** and **Vite**.  
Players flip cards to find matching pairs. If two flipped cards do not match, they flip back over. The game tracks moves and score and displays a win message once all pairs are matched.

## 🎮 How the Game Works

- The game starts with a grid of face-down cards
- Each card hides a symbol (emojis)
- Players flip **two cards at a time**
- If the cards match:
  - They remain face-up
  - The score increases
- If the cards do **not** match:
  - They flip back over
- The game ends when all matching pairs are found

## Purpose
